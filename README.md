# Task Warrior Config
> The license is just in case I need to explicitly say someone can use this even though it's not really my code, just a config.

Here is my task warrior config. It doesn't differ much from the standard, but it's differences make it much more useful to me personally.
## Lables
### Effort Lable
Effort is how long the task is expected to take.
- XS = 30 minutes
- S = 1 hour
- M = 2 hours
- L = 4 hours
- XL = idk, but it will probably take a while
### Type
The 'Type' lable is used to describe the type of work in question. I use it mainly for `feature`, `bug`, `refactor`. An entry with the type of `bug` will be highlighted in red and it's coefficient is much higher. The idea being that bugs should have a higher priority.
## Structure
I've separated out the coefficients, uda definitions, and colors out into their own files to make it easier to find things.
## Colors
I've started to make the colors more...to my liking. Haven't completed them though
